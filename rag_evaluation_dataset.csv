What is linear regression?,Linear regression predicts continuous output using a line of best fit and is optimized via least squares or gradient descent.
What is logistic regression used for?,Logistic regression is used for binary classification and outputs a probability between 0 and 1 using a sigmoid function.
Explain the role of decision trees in machine learning.,Decision trees are models that split data based on features using criteria like Gini Impurity or Entropy.
What are the benefits of random forests?,Random forests are ensembles of decision trees that reduce overfitting and provide robustness.
How does KNN algorithm work?,K-Nearest Neighbors classifies based on the majority class among the K closest data points.
What is Q-learning?,Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal policy using the Bellman equation.
Describe the Transformer model architecture.,"The Transformer is a model based solely on attention mechanisms, removing recurrence and convolutions entirely."
What is self-attention in transformers?,Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence regardless of their position.
What is multi-head attention?,"Multi-head attention applies attention multiple times in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different subspaces."
What is the purpose of positional encoding in transformers?,Positional encoding injects information about the order of tokens since transformers lack recurrence.
